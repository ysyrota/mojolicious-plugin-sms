DESCRIPTION
    Provides a quick and easy way to send SMS messages using SMS::Send
    drivers (of which there are many, so chances are the service you want to
    use is already supported; if not, they're easy to write, and if you want
    to change providers later, you can simply update a few lines in your
    config file, and you're done.
